# Hospital Management System Conversion Plan

## Overview
Convert the existing Hotel Operations Management System to a comprehensive Hospital Management System with Patient and Pharmacy Management capabilities.

## Mapping Current Features to Hospital Features

### Hotel Feature -> Hospital Equivalent
- Room Management -> Patient Room Management
- Guest Requests -> Patient Requests/Medical Requests
- Staff Management -> Medical Staff Management
- Inventory Management -> Pharmacy & Medical Inventory
- Housekeeping -> Patient Care & Cleaning Protocols
- Maintenance -> Medical Equipment Maintenance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Data Structure Conversion
1. Update `data.json` structure to support:
   - Patient records instead of guest records
   - Medical staff instead of hotel staff
   - Patient rooms instead of hotel rooms
   - Medical requests instead of guest requests
   - Pharmacy inventory instead of hotel inventory

### Phase 2: Backend API Conversion
1. Update all API endpoints to handle medical data:
   - `/api/patients` instead of `/api/rooms`
   - `/api/medical-requests` instead of `/api/requests`
   - `/api/pharmacy` instead of `/api/inventory`
   - Update authentication for medical staff roles
   - Implement medical-specific business logic

### Phase 3: Frontend UI Conversion
1. Update all components to reflect medical terminology:
   - Dashboard to show patient metrics instead of hotel metrics
   - Navigation to reflect medical workflows
   - Forms to collect medical information
   - Patient management screens
   - Pharmacy management screens

### Phase 4: New Feature Implementation
1. Implement Patient Management System features:
   - Patient registration and demographics
   - Medical records management
   - Appointment scheduling
   - Ward and bed management
   - Care team coordination

2. Implement Pharmacy Management System features:
   - Medication management
   - Prescription processing
   - Inventory tracking
   - Dispensing management
   - Patient medication records

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. Test all converted functionality
2. Ensure data consistency
3. Validate security and compliance requirements
4. User acceptance testing
